# Projectmanagement

## A small Web-App for organizing a project with tasks.
Build by [@Phil96](https://github.com/Phil96) and [@GrafHeinrich](https://github.com/GrafHeinrich) for a study assignment concerning [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Current Functionalities:
* :white_check_mark: `Adding` a Project and:
    * give it a name
    * give it a description
* :white_check_mark: `Editing` an existing project
* :white_check_mark: `Delete` an existing project

## What's to come?
* Creating Tasks and add them to projects
* Adding Users to your Project
